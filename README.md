# mlcheck

`mlcheck` is a command line tool to check for ML best practices in different coding documents.

This tool is primarily intended as a checklist (or a spell-check equiavlent for ML best practices) for your own ML coding files.

This tool was in part inspired by the <a href="https://mbnuijten.com/statcheck/" target="_blank">>statcheck</a> project.

If you have Rust and Cargo installed, can install the `mlcheck` crate from <a href="https://crates.io/" target="_blank">crates.io</a> using:

`cargo add mlcheck`

Note: `mlcheck` is at an incredibly early stage and is under active development. Breaking changes are likely.
